# TODO:

* load some stats
* drag n drop stats in attribute fields


# Concept:
* separate stats in offense/defense
* separate stats in smaller is good, bigger is good

* > 2 players playfield is a regular polygon with each player in a corneri or middle of edge


# Improvment:
* spawn particles in an arc in front of player instead of inside him


# Stats:
* defense balls and offense balls
    * defense balls are balls with large mass and large air friction (they stop in front of player)
* Super ball spawn chance: extra mass/damage



----
playing with mouse constraint is so cool, maybe scale the damage to the speed of constrainted particle
playing with no borders but an obstacle in the middle is also cool
